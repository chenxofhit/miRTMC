# The [miRTMC](http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/miRTMC/) WebSite

## INTRODUCTION

Long non-coding RNAs (long ncRNAs, lncRNA) are non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. Recent recognition that long ncRNAs function in various aspects of cell biology has focused increasing attention on their potential to contribute towards disease etiology. The miRTMC is a free web server for lncRNA-disease association prediction


## Note

This is the webservice implementation of ![miRTMC](http://github.com/hjiangcsu/miRTMC). The paper "miRTMC: A miRNA target prediction method based on matrix completion algorithm", which is submitted to the Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, is still under review, any question please navigate there and submit issues ![there](http://github.com/hjiangcsu/miRTMC/issues).
